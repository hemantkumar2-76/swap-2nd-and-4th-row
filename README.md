Github Contribution Rules
Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.
The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
This year, the first 50,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.
